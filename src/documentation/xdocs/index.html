	<h1>Dido - Data In Data Out</h1>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>Dido provides a utiity to map Java to and from external
	data formats such as CSV and fixed with flat files, or Excel.</p>
	
	<p>Why yet another such framework when there are already so many?
	Here are Dido's requirements.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The data specification must be two way. A
		<a href="reference/org/oddjob/dido/DataPlanType">dido:plan</a>
		created by the developer provider by the developer can
		be given to the developers reading data downstream so they
		can use it immediately in their applications. No more file 
		specifications that drift out of date or are ambiguous. The plan
		is the plan.
		</li>
		
		<li>The plan must not contain Java bean mapping information. 
		Again, this is to facilitate the exchange of plans.
		One developers Apple type is
		another developers Fruit type. Most other mapping frameworks mix Java 
		mapping information and data layout information.</li>
		
	</ul>	
	
	<h3>Installing and Using Dido</h3>
	
	<p>Dido is an extension to the 
	<a href="http://rgordon.co.uk/projects/oddjob">Oddjob</a> task execution
	framework. To install Dido unzip the dido-n.n.n.zip file over your 
	existing <code>oddjob</code>
	directory. After instalation the Oddjob directories should have been 
	modified to look something like this.

	</code></pre>
	
	<p>
	The oj-poi Oddball is an optional extension to Dido for reading
	and writing Microsoft Excel files. The <code>oj-poi</code> directory
	and it's contents may be deleted if reading and writing to Excel is
	not required.
	</p>
	
	<p>When you next start Oddjob, the Dido job definitions will be
	available to use in your Oddjob configurations.
